- If no existing ticket associated with the given operational event, then the event needs to be analyzed and acted on for the following:
    1. When the notified event has associated ticket(s) open already and the 'Event Last Updated Time' is not newer than that of the tickets, the event must be 'discharged'. There are no further action needed when it is discharged.
    2. When the notified event does not indicate substantial impact/risk and requires no customer actions, the event must be 'discharged'. There are no further action needed when it is discharged.
    3. When the notified event indicates substantial impact/risk or requires customer actions, the event must be 'accepted'. Then an issue ticket must be created to track the status of remediation actions and the ownership of actions.
